        <h1>Snorkeling, Sandbank & Sunset Cruise Trip</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="moreExcursion">
        <p>
          The half day snorkeling, sandbank and sunset cruise tour commences at
          2 PM and lasts for 4 hours, coming to a close at 6 PM, which is well
          after sunset for The Maldives. Since the tour is organized every day
          of the week, it is possible to book as per your convenience.
        </p>
        <h5>Sunbathing on a Sandbank</h5>
        <p>
          When the boat docks some distance away from the deserted sandbank, you
          will get your cue to jump into the shallow water and stride over to
          the shimmering white sandbank. You will be provided with a sun
          umbrella to keep you cool in the Maldivian afternoon sun, which can be
          pretty strong.
        </p>
        <h5>Snorkeling Site Visits</h5>
        <p>
          After relaxing on the sandbank, you will next be taken to a couple of
          snorkeling sites in Maldives. These dive sites are not always
          pre-decided as the final selection depends on the weather and
          visibility. Snorkeling is best done on a clear day when the chances of
          rain are slim and the winds are not too strong. There are many
          exciting fish, sea plants and coral reefs that you can expect to see
          on the two snorkeling dives. Look out for the popular clown fish, tiny
          schooling fish, starfish, stingrays, manta rays, and most importantly,
          both hard and soft corals. You might also spot some turtles if you are
          lucky.
        </p>
        <h5>Dolphin Spotting on a Sunset Cruise</h5>
        <p>
          After the final dive, it will be time for sunset, and also a signal
          for you to return to HulhuMalé Island. However, unlike the onward
          cruise, the return journey has a couple of special things about it.
          You will not only be able to relish the stunning Maldivian sunset from
          the ocean, but also catch some playful dolphins travelling with their
          pods in the horizon. It is hard to miss the rhythm and coordination of
          these water mammals that always leap out of the sea for oxygen.
